# 🎉 SampleDiscordBot 🎉

This is a template for someone who would want a starting point in making their bot.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install discord (the python package). 

**Note: my python version is 3.7.8, this may differ to you.**
## Windows [REM is a comment]:
```
C:\> python -m pip install discord
C:\> REM Do this to check if it installed
C:\> python -m discord
C:\> REM No errors means it's installed :D
C:\> REM Finally run this command to run the bot
C:\> python filename.py
```
